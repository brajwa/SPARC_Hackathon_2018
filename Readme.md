Spat-An-App!


This is a Spatial Anatomy Application that aims to project image data into a Spatial Projection space based on Point pattern analysis. 
Requirements: R and Python

Goals: Quantify the spatial organization of cells

Point Pattern Analysis
- Study of the spatial arrangements of points in 2-dimensional space
- The null model for point patterns is complete spatial randomness modeled as a Poisson process in R^


The functions for point pattern analysis used in this app include:
  Ripley's K-function, and its normalized form, the L function.
  J-function comparing NN-distances and empty space distances.
